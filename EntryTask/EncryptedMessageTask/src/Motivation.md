### How I decided to start programming ?
When I was little, like every other boy, I was playing a lot of games and 
as every other boy "I wanted to work with computers".
In school I studied electronic, and I was going to stick with it, 
but at final grade I was watching a lot of youtube videos and talks about Artificial Intelligence,
Virtual reality, and Mathematics and it was so interesting, I changed my mind about the electronics,
I decided to study math or computer science.

### What is that I like and what motivates me to continue learning?
I like that I can be a part of the IT world and part of the future (I also like mathematics).
The things that motivate me to continue learning are the interesting ideas 
you find in the world of proggraming and mathematics, and they increase every day.
I want to be in the front line and catch up with the new things.

### What are my expectations for the Algorithms course?
I expect interesting and challenging course with a lot of practical tasks, not just straightforward algorithms.
